## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am programming because it is my hobby for more than 40 years and partly my job fo more than 20 years.
I am working in a big tech company as an application developer for HVAC devices. Around this technology there is always a lot of side-works to develop helping tools, SCADA drivers, little funny devices for non standard solutions.
Therefore little of C, C++, regulary IEC ST and a lot of C# is something I use mostly daily.

If you find something usefull here, I will be happy.
If you are in my mindset, contact me :)
